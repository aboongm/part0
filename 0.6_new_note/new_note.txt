Browser->Server: HTTP GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/new_note_spa

Note over browser:
When the input field is filled and submit,
there is only one HTTP POST request.
The server gives a HTTP status code 201.
The POST request to the address new_note_spa contains the new note 
as JSON-data containing both the content of the note (content) and 
the timestamp (date).
The Content-Type header of the request tells the server that the
included data is represented in the JSON format.

The SPA version of the app does not send the form data in the traditional way,
as we can see in the form tag, there is action attribute
but instead uses the JavaScript code it fetched from the server.
The JavaScript code using event handler creates a new note, 
adds it to the notes list with the command notes.push(note), 
rerenders the note list on the page and sends the new note to the server.
end note
